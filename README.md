# RAG
This repository contains a complete PDF Question-Answering RAG system powered by Mistral (Ollama). It extracts text from PDFs, chunks and embeds the content, stores embeddings using FAISS, and uses an LLM to generate context-aware answers. A simple, fast, offline RAG implementation ideal for learning and local experimentation.
